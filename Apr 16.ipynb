    "\n",
    "The boosting process starts by training a base learner on the original training data. After the initial training, the algorithm assigns weights to \n",
    "each training example, indicating their importance or difficulty in the learning process. The subsequent base learners are then trained on modified \n",

    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Advantages of using boosting techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Improved Predictive Accuracy: Boosting can significantly enhance the predictive accuracy compared to using a single base learner. By combining \n",
    "    multiple weak learners, boosting can effectively reduce bias and variance, leading to more accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Handling Complex Relationships: Boosting algorithms can capture complex relationships between features and the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Feature Importance: Boosting algorithms can provide insights into feature importance. By examining the weights or importance assigned to features \n",
    "    during the boosting process, it becomes possible to identify the most influential features in the prediction.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Robustness to Overfitting: Boosting algorithms are less prone to overfitting compared to some other techniques. The sequential training process, \n",
    "    which focuses on the most difficult examples, helps prevent overfitting by iteratively adjusting the model's biases and improving generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations of using boosting techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sensitivity to Noisy Data and Outliers: Boosting algorithms can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers, as they tend to assign higher weights to\n",
    "    misclassified examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Computational Complexity: Boosting typically involves training multiple base learners sequentially, which can be computationally expensive, \n",
    "    especially if the dataset is large and the number of iterations is high. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Difficulty in Parallelization: Each base learner's training depends on the results of the previous one, limiting the ability to distribute the \n",
