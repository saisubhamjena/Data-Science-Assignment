    "#Q1. What is Web Scraping? Why is it Used? Give three areas where Web Scraping is used to get data.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Web scraping refers to the process of automatically extracting information or data from websites using specialized software tools or programs. \n",
    "The process involves parsing the HTML source code of a webpage and extracting the relevant data for further analysis or use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is used for a variety of reasons, including data mining, market research, price monitoring, and competitive intelligence. It can be \n",
    "an efficient way to collect large amounts of data from multiple sources without the need for manual data entry.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the main applications of webscraping are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. E-commerce: Web scraping is often used by e-commerce companies to extract product information from competitors' websites. This information \n",
    "               can be used for price monitoring, product research, and competitive intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Research: Web scraping is also used in academic research to collect data from various sources, including social media, news websites, and \n",
    "            government databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Finance: Web scraping is increasingly used in the finance industry to collect and analyze financial data, such as stock prices, market trends, \n",
    "            and economic indicators. This information can be used to make informed investment decisions and identify new market opportunities.\n",

    "\"\"\"\n",
    "There are different methods used for web scraping, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Manual Scraping: This method involves manually copying and pasting data from websites into a spreadsheet or text file. While this method is \n",
    "         time-consuming and not practical for large amounts of data, it can be useful for small-scale data scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Web Scraping Tools: There are various tools available for web scraping, such as BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, and Selenium. These tools allow users to \n",
    "         extract data from websites by writing code in Python or other programming languages. They can be used to automate the web scraping process \n",
    "         and extract data from large volumes of web pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Application Programming Interface (API): Many websites offer APIs that allow developers to access data in a structured format. These APIs can be \n",
    "         used to extract data in a more efficient and reliable way than traditional web scraping methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Data-as-a-Service (DaaS): DaaS providers offer access to large datasets collected from multiple sources, including websites. These providers \n",
    "         typically offer APIs or web interfaces to access the data, which can be useful for businesses and researchers who need access to large \n",
