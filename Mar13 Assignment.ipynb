    "2.Homogeneity of variance: The variance of the data within each group should be approximately equal. Violations of this assumption can result in an\n",
    "  increased risk of Type I errors (false positives) or Type II errors (false negatives).\n",
    "3.Independence: The observations within each group should be independent of each other. Violations of this assumption can result in an increased \n",

    "\n",
    "Examples of violations that could impact the validity of ANOVA results include:\n",
    "1.Non-normality: If the data is not normally distributed within each group, ANOVA may not accurately test for significant differences. \n",

    "2.Heterogeneity of variance: If the variance of the data within each group is not equal, ANOVA may not accurately test for significant differences.\n",
    "  For example, if one group has a much larger variance than the others, ANOVA may incorrectly identify significant differences.\n",
    "3.Dependence: If the observations within each group are not independent of each other, ANOVA may not accurately test for significant differences.\n",
