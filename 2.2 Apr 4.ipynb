    "To measure the purity of a subset, we need a metric that tells us how well the data points in the subset are separated by the input feature we are \n",

    "on the feature). The feature with the highest information gain is the one that is chosen for the split.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 4: Building the Tree\n",
