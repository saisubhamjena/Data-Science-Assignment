    "    are no longer directly related to the predictor variables.\n",

    "    and L2 penalties in Elastic Net. Choosing the optimal values for these hyperparameters can be challenging, and the performance of the model can be\n",
    "    sensitive to their selection.\n",
    "4. Outliers: Regularized linear models assume that the data is normally distributed and that there are no extreme outliers in the predictor variables.\n",
    "    However, if the data contains outliers, the regularization penalty may not be able to effectively reduce their influence, and the resulting model \n",
